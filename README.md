# YouTube Video Downloader

The program allows you to choose any youtube url and save that video to any file directory. If you would like to use it, simply download the python file and pip install the necessary libraries. Because this is a basic program, it uses â€œprogressive downloads," so only resolutions 720p and below are returned.

## Proof

For the record, I have YouTube Premium. This is simply for testing purposes.
